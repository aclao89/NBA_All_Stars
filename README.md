TThe National Basketball Association All-Star Game is a basketball exhibition game hosted every February by the National Basketball Association (NBA) and showcases 24 of the league's star players. It is the featured event of NBA All-Star Weekend, a three-day event which goes from Friday to Sunday. The All-Star Game was first played at the Boston Garden on March 2, 1951.

The starting lineup for each squad is selected by a combination of fan, player, and media voting, [1] while head coaches choose the reserves. The starting five from each conference consists of three frontcourt players and two guards.

In this project, I performed an exploratory analysis of the NBA All-Stars roster from 2000 to 2016 to examine the commonalities and differences of an All-Star.
